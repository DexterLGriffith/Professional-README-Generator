# Professional-README-Generator

This is a Professional README generator application designed to allow the user enter in the information for their project and have a professional style readme generated. 

## Description 

Build a professional README generator from scratch using node.js and the skills learned from the previous weeks. I will build a node.js application which allows the user to input information into the node index.js terminal, and output the information into a professionally designed README.md file. 

## Takes Completed

1. Created basic file from Github with README.md, license and initial index.js file. 
2. Created initial shell for project on index.js 
3. Initialized and ran npm to allow project to run in terminal.
4. created .gitignore file, to ignore certain files like node_modules, which arent necessary for pushing to github. 
5. Made question sheets which prompt in the terminal, when running the program. 

    **Example: 
        
        message: "List out the steps needed to complete this  project",
        name: "tasks",
        type: "input",
6. Made section in index.js file, which prompts creation of README.md file when user answers questions prompted onto the terminal. 
7. Made template for README to follow when filling in the user input into the file.
8. Made sure file looked of professional quality, and uploaded to Github.  

## Installation

1. Download files from the repository
2. Open index.js and a command terminal for the folder.
3. Initialize npm within file terminal.  
4. Within terminal, type in node index.js and answer questions within prompts.

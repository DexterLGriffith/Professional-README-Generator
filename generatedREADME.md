    ## Description
    
    Build a professional README generator from scratch using node.js, which allows the user to input information into the node index.js termainl, and output the information into a professionally designed README.md file. 

    ## Tasks Completed

    Created a basic file from Github with README.md, license and initial index.js file.
    Created the initial shell for the project on index.js file, then initialized npm and ran npm to allow the project to run in the terminal. 
    Created .gitignore file to ignore certain files, created question template as well as a readme template for the users information to be filed into after input.

    ## Installation 

    Download files from the repository, open index.js and a command terminal for the folder. Initialize npm within the file terminal, type in node index.js and answer questions within prompts.

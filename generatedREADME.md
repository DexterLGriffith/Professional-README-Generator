    ## Description
    
    Build a professional README generator from scratch using node.js and the skills learned from the previous weeks. I will build a node.js application which allows the user to input information into the node index.js terminal and output the information into a professionallyt designed README.md file.

    ## Tasks Completed

    1. Created basic file from Github with README.md, license and initial index.js file.

    2. Created initial shell for project on index.js, and initialized and ran npm to allow project to run in terminal.

    3. Created .gitignore file, to ignore files, and made question sheets which promp in the terminal when running the program. Finally made a section in index.js file, which prompts creation of README.md file when user answers questions prompted onto the terminal. 

    ## Installation 

    Download files from the repo, and open index.js and the command terminal for the folder. Initialize npm within file and type in node.js and answer questions.
